                <br>
                <p>E-dating can be very positive, and it can bring people together not only in the virtual environment,
                    but also in the real world too. In some cases, people form strong bonds and end up meeting up. Many
                    that are in online game relationships aren’t seeking a life-long partner, but rather a person they
                    can talk to and play with, and they just want to have a more intimate online friend. This isn’t a
                    normal thing everyone wants, and it’s frowned upon by most. E-daters often have a cringe set of
                    matching usernames and/or profile pictures and can often talk differently, for example, when the
                    girl talks with a softer, baby-like voice to signify to everyone else that they are "dating." This
                    is annoying to most.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Online game relationships can be a good thing, and most of them are, but there are more instances
                    than not where one of the two isn’t who they said they are. As I mentioned earlier, some have found
                    life-long relationships out of it, but that’s not usually how it ends up. Since this is all
                    happening online, it’s not only easier for it to be kept a secret by your child, for example, but
                    it’s also easier for older individuals to look for younger victims. They will target younger, more
                    naïve people who haven't been taught the dangers of the internet. If this is what the older
                    individual wants, they could get inappropriate illegal pictures and either have them for themselves,
                    sell them, or blackmail either the victim and/or the parents of the victim. Sadly, this isn’t a rare
                    occurrence, but it is something parents need to be aware of.

                <p>
                    Making sure your kid(s) know that they need to be wary on the internet is the first and biggest step
                    in letting them get access to the virtual world. I would recommend sitting down and talking to them
                    about it. While doing this, however, make sure to talk about and/or show them examples. Something
                    about the human mind is that it will go against you and try to do the opposite if it thinks
                    something is stupid or unnecessary. Not showing them things that happened in the past and what could
                    possibly happen to them if they’re not cautious will help discourage them from doing what you’ve
                    told them.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    There are some positives in online gaming relationships, but they're mostly negative. They can be
                    harmless fun; they could also be serious or just someone messing with others, but it also opens up
                    for corrupted people to find victims easier than ever. Making sure your kid(s) knows about this is
                    important. All in all, having an online relationship is unsafe, and it’s likely that they’re not who
                    they told you they were. So, I’d recommend staying away from it and just avoiding anything related
                    to e-dating, in games or on servers, and just ignoring anyone asking you about anything similar to
                    that.
